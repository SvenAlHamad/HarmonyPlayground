Harmony playground
===================

This repo is a showcase of the new features available in EcmaScript 6 (Harmony).
The demos use [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) compiler so the scripts can run in any modern browser, 
no need to compile or anything...just open it in your browser and everything should work.

## Webiny Platform

As part of my work on [Webiny Platform](http://www.webiny.com/) (GitHub: http://github.com/Webiny/) I'm testing out the 
 new features of EC6 and considering using some parts of it.
